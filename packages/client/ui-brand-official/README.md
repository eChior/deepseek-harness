English | [中文](README.zh.md)

## Summary

This package gives the sidebar this distribution's corporate mark and short corporate name. The occupants register under every client build profile, so a locally assembled client shows the distribution's identity instead of the shell's fish mark and local-build label. The conversation hero keeps the animated fish from `dsh-client-ui-conversation`, which this package does not occupy. It has no runtime state and does not affect model requests.

## Use this package

Mount this plugin in the browser roster of this distribution's client. The occupants register under every client build profile, so nothing here waits for a named profile before the brand appears.

### Registering the brand

The occupants register unconditionally rather than behind a build profile: a locally assembled client shows the corporate mark and name, and the shell's fallbacks never render. The artwork ships with the package as build-time literals — the mark as an inline PNG data URL, the name as a font outline filled with `currentColor` — so the bundle needs no asset-loader rule and the client i18n gate sees no untranslated copy. The conversation hero still shows the animated hero fish from `dsh-client-ui-conversation`, because this package does not occupy that slot.

### Replacing the brand

A deployment with its own identity leaves this package out and composes another package that occupies the sidebar slots — and the hero slot, which this package leaves on its fallback. Occupying a slot is the only composition route; there is no brand configuration surface here.

## Understand the implementation

<details>
<summary>Implementation internals — click to expand</summary>

The two occupants install as one declaration-aware registration set: nested `ctx.slots.inject()` calls wait on the sidebar declaration, so the set works whether this row activates before or after the declarer, withdraws both occupants when the declaration collapses, and leaves no partial brand mix during HMR. The browser half is [`src/client/index.ts`](src/client/index.ts), the artwork lives in [`src/client/brand-art.ts`](src/client/brand-art.ts), and the node half is an empty Loader seat. The browser title is a build-environment concern (`DSH_CLIENT_TITLE`), outside the slot system.

## Further Exploration

Read these pages when the brand surface is not enough. They move from the slots this package occupies to the shell that renders them.

- [ui-sidebar](../ui-sidebar/README.md) — declares `sidebar.brand.mark` and `sidebar.brand.name` and renders their fallbacks.
- [ui-conversation](../ui-conversation/README.md) — declares `conversation.hero.brand.mark` in the hero.
- [Web client architecture](../../../.agents/notes/implemented/architecture/2026-07-19-gui-web-client-architecture.md) — how browser plugin rows load and register slots.

## Model Experience

None, as the package contributes browser presentation only; nothing here reaches a model request.

#### KV Cache effect

None; this package neither assembles nor sends a provider request.

## Known Limitations and Deferred Work

<a id="known-limitations-and-deferred-work"></a>


These limits define how brand presentation is supplied. They are current package constraints, not a brand-design comparison or a task backlog.

- **One occupant set** — alternative presentation belongs in another Cordis package occupying the same slots.
- **The browser title is independent** — `DSH_CLIENT_TITLE` selects title text at build time rather than through a UI slot.

### Dev Note

<details>
<summary>Working context for maintainers — click to expand</summary>

None.

</details>

**Runtime invariant:** No companion is published. The package retains no mutable state, and its two slot occupants install and leave through one transactional effect.
